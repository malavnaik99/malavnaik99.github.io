A data analytics project analysing **Irish employment permits issued to companies in 2025**, with the goal of uncovering real hiring demand across sectors, employers, and time.

This repository combines **public labour-market data**, **exploratory analysis**, and an **interactive web dashboard** to demonstrate how open datasets can support career planning, workforce insights, and evidence-based job search strategies.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Ireland’s employment permit data offers a valuable proxy for understanding where international hiring demand exists. In this project, I analysed the official **“Permits Issued to Companies – 2025”** dataset to answer questions such as:

* Which sectors are sponsoring the most employment permits?
* How concentrated is hiring among top employers?
* Are there seasonal patterns in permit issuance?
* What can students and early-career professionals infer about demand timing and industries?

The outcome is a **clean, interactive dashboard** supported by transparent data processing and clear visual storytelling.

## 📊 Key Insights

Some high-level findings from the analysis:

* **Technology, Healthcare, and Manufacturing-related organisations** account for a significant share of permits
* **Hiring demand peaks in specific months**, indicating seasonality in employer sponsorship activity
* **A relatively small group of employers** accounts for a large proportion of total permits issued
* Employment permits can act as a **leading indicator of skills demand** in the Irish labour market

These insights are especially useful for:

* Students planning skill development
* Early-career professionals targeting sponsorship-ready employers
* Recruiters and analysts tracking labour-market demand

## 🖥️ Interactive Dashboard

The project includes a responsive HTML dashboard featuring:

* **Key metrics summary** (total permits, top sector, peak month, top employer)
* **Monthly permit issuance chart** highlighting demand velocity
* **Sector-wise permit distribution**
* **Searchable Top Employers table** with sector tagging and relative impact indicators

The dashboard is built using:

* **HTML5 & Tailwind CSS** for layout and styling
* **Chart.js** for data visualisation
* **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity and filtering
